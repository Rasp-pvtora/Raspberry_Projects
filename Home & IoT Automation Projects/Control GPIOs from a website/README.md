# Overview
The Control GPIOs from a Website project is a Raspberry Pi-based system that enables users to control General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins remotely via a secure web interface, allowing automation and interaction with physical devices such as LEDs, relays, motors, or sensors in real-world applications like home automation, smart agriculture, or small-scale industrial control.
The system uses a Raspberry Pi to interface with GPIO-connected devices, hosted on a Flask web server with real-time updates via WebSocket for responsive control. It supports user authentication, logging of GPIO actions for auditing, and integration with IoT devices for scalable automation. The project is ideal for scenarios requiring remote device control, such as turning on lights, activating irrigation pumps, or monitoring sensor states from anywhere.

# Functionality
- **Remote GPIO Control**: Users access a web interface to toggle GPIO pins (e.g., turn on/off a relay controlling a light or motor) or read sensor states (e.g., temperature from a DHT22 sensor).
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket ensures instant feedback on the web interface when GPIO states change, reflecting device status (e.g., "Light ON").
- **User Authentication**: Secures the web interface with login credentials (username/password) to prevent unauthorized access, critical for home or industrial use.
- **Action Logging**: Logs all GPIO operations (e.g., pin toggled, timestamp, user) to a SQLite database for auditing and troubleshooting.
- **Device Integration**: Supports controlling multiple devices (e.g., relays, LEDs, servos) and reading inputs from sensors (e.g., motion, temperature) via GPIO pins.
- **Responsive Interface**: The web interface is mobile-friendly, built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Tailwind CSS, allowing control from smartphones or desktops.
- **Automation Rules**: Allows users to define simple rules (e.g., "turn on fan if temperature > 25Â°C") via the web interface, stored in the database.
- **Alert Notifications**: Sends alerts via email or Telegram for critical events (e.g., motion sensor triggered, GPIO failure).

# Detailed Functionality:
- ### Web Interface Control:
    - A Flask-based web interface displays buttons or sliders for each GPIO pin (e.g., "Toggle Relay 1", "Read DHT22").
    - Users log in with credentials, verified against hashed passwords in SQLite.
    - Clicking a button sends a WebSocket message to toggle a GPIO pin (e.g., set pin 18 HIGH to activate a relay).
    - Real-time updates reflect the current state (e.g., "Relay 1: ON") using Flask-SocketIO.

- ### GPIO Interaction:
    - Outputs: Control devices like relays (for lights, pumps) or servos (for valves) by setting GPIO pins HIGH/LOW.
    - Inputs: Read sensor states (e.g., DHT22 for temperature/humidity, PIR for motion) and display on the web interface.
    - Supports PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) for precise control (e.g., servo angles).

- ### Automation Rules:
    - Users define rules via the web interface (e.g., "If DHT22 temperature > 25Â°C, set Relay 2 HIGH").
    - Rules are stored in SQLite and evaluated periodically by a background thread.
    - Rules can trigger GPIO actions or send alerts (e.g., motion detected by PIR sensor).

- ### Action Logging:
    - Every GPIO operation (e.g., pin toggle, sensor read) is logged to SQLite with timestamp, user, and action details.
    - Logs can be queried via the web interface (e.g., "Show all relay toggles today").

- ### Security and Reliability:
    - Uses HTTPS (via Nginx) to secure web access.
    - Stores passwords with bcrypt hashing (via Passlib).
    - Implements rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
    - UPS ensures continuous operation during power outages.

- ### Notifications:
    - Sends Telegram or email alerts for critical events (e.g., motion detected, GPIO failure).
    - Alerts include context (e.g., "Motion detected at 15:30 on Pin 17").

- ### Scalability:
    - Supports multiple GPIO devices (e.g., 4 relays, 2 sensors) on a single Pi.
    - Integrates with MQTT for IoT ecosystems (e.g., Home Assistant) to control external devices.

# Software Workflow
- The Pi Camera detects and captures a vehicle entering the gate.
- **Extract_PlateNumber(image)** processes the frame, returning "XYZ123".
- **Search_Existing_Plate("XYZ123")** checks the database; if not found, **Add_New_Plate("XYZ123")** creates a new entry.
- **Log_Vehicle_Entry("XYZ123", "Sedan", "Red", NOW())** logs the entry with details from YOLOv9.
- **Check_Watchlist("XYZ123")** verifies if the plate is flagged; if so, **Send_Alert("XYZ123", NOW(), "Main Gate")** notifies operators.
- In low-light, **Process_Thermal_Image(image)** detects vehicles, feeding back to the main loop.
- The web dashboard periodically calls **Generate_Heatmap(today, today+1)** to display activity trends.

### Tips:
- Train YOLOv9 on a dataset of local vehicle types and license plate formats to improve accuracy.
- Use a high-capacity SD card (e.g., 64GB) for local data caching during network outages.
- Regularly update Tesseract OCR models to handle new plate designs.

### Extra Features & Upgrades:
- **Biometric Integration**: Add fingerprint scanners for driver verification, enhancing security.
- **LoRaWAN Support**: Use LoRaWAN for long-range communication in rural areas, reducing reliance on WiFi.
- **Smart Lock Integration**: Control gates with MQTT-enabled smart locks for automated access.
- **Live Heatmaps**: Display real-time vehicle activity on a map-based dashboard for quick insights.
- **Voice Alerts**: Use a speaker to announce alerts locally (e.g., "Unknown vehicle detected", "Suspicious vehicle", ...).
- **Police API Integration**: Sync with law enforcement databases for real-time suspect tracking (subject to legal approval).
