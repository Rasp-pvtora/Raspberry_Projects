# üìÇ Folder list:
Here there is a description for each sub-folders in this repository:

###üí° Hardware & Sensor Projects
- ### **üíª Control GPIOs from a website**
  This project involves creating a web-based interface to remotely control the Raspberry Pi's General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins. It's a foundational skill for building web-controlled home automation projects. It's a perfect entry point for beginners because it combines hardware (GPIOs) with software (web development), demonstrating the core capabilities of the Raspberry Pi. It's a stepping stone to countless other projects.
- ### **üì∑ Send and email with attachment (photo or text)**
  A simple project to program the Raspberry Pi to send an email, often triggered by an event like a button press or motion detection, and include an attached photo from a connected camera. This is a very common and practical project. It's a great way to learn about scripting, email protocols (SMTP), and integrating a camera module, making it very popular for security and monitoring applications.
- ### **Control and get notification with Telegram**
  This project focuses on using the Telegram API to send messages and control the Raspberry Pi. It's often used to receive alerts from sensors or to send commands to the Rasp-Pi from a smartphone. Telegram is a favorite for this kind of project due to its open and user-friendly API, which makes building interactive bots straightforward and reliable.

## What does n8n mean?

**Short answer:** It means "nodemation" and is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** "I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. 'node-' in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses Node.js and '-mation' for 'automation' which is what the project is supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on 'n8n'." - **Jan Oberhauser, Founder and CEO, n8n.io**
